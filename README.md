# The `all-versions` branch
Hey!! how did you get here?? no, genuinely, how? or rather, why?
why are you looking through this weird guy's fork?

whatever...<br>
some versions have been discontinued in the [official mpkmod repo](https://github.com/MPKMod/MPKMod2),
so here they are! ill try to keep this updated for as long as i have
the motivation to maintain a branch that no one even knows about lol

oh also this will not contain all the extra changes/fixes from `integration/master` bc why not

have a great day! if it's not going well, then think about how desperate i am to write this readme...
or go listen to twenty one pilot's last album breach RIGHT NOW!! on top of that i'm french (kill me)

more seriously i'm sure you'll do better some day! hard times are just a thing,
we have to deal with that...<br>
